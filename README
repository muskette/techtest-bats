BATS Tech Test

Time Spent: 3-4 Hours
Apologies for the lack of frontend.
With the limited time I had, I decided to focus on backend skills like django, sql and designing for a scalable architecture


Running the server:
Have sqlite installed
Install virtual environment
If you want to start from scratch, delete db.sqlite3
Run django migration
Initialise data if db.sqlite3 was removed
Run django server or shell

To initalise data:
Run django shell
> from umtf.servics.load_fixtures import load_umtfs, load_trades
Run those functions with the appropriate file paths (given files are in 'umtf/fixtures')
> from umtf.tasks import update_latest_stock_values
> update_latest_stock_values()

To Do further:
    - Implement Bootstrap or similar frontend tool
    - Implement all test functions and expand code coverage
    - Make load_fixtures package more robust
        - Don't want to drop whole file if one row fails
        - Appropriately log failures to console
